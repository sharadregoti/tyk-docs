This page provides guidance for upgrading your Tyk installation. When upgrading Tyk, you need to consider each component (e.g. Gateway, Pump, Dashboard) separately, taking into account the deployment style you've implemented. We have structured this guide by deployment type (e.g. Cloud, Self-Managed, etc.) to keep all the information you need in one place.

All our components adhere to a few common standards:

- We do not introduce breaking changes unless specifically stated in the release notes (and it rarely happens).
- Check our [versioning and long-term-support policies]({{< ref "developer-support/long-term-support-releases" >}}) for more details on the way we release major and minor features, patches and the support dates for each release.
- Make sure you have planned an [upgrade strategy]({{< ref "developer-support/upgrading-tyk/upgrade-strategy" >}}).
- Make sure you have consulted the [upgrade prerequisites]({{< ref "developer-support/upgrading-tyk/upgrade-prerequisites" >}}) before starting the upgrade.
- Make sure you follow our [comprehensive guide for backing up Tyk]({{< ref "frequently-asked-questions/how-to-backup-tyk" >}}) before starting the upgrade.
- If you experience any issues with the new version you pulled, please contact Tyk Support or [Tyk community forum](https://community.tyk.io/).


## Upgrade Guides
