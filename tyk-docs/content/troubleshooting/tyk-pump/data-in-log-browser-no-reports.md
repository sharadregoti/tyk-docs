### Description

You can see data in the log browser but the rest of the reports display nothing.

### Solution

If your Pump is configured to use `mongo_selective_pump` (e.g. store data in a collection per organization), ensure that the [Dashboard configuration setting]({{< ref "tyk-dashboard/configuration" >}}) `use_sharded_analytics` is set to `true`. 

The same applies in the reverse direction. If you are using `mongo-pump-aggregate` in your [pump configuration]({{< ref "tyk-pump/configuration" >}}), set `use_sharded_analytics` to false.

This is because you've enabled `use_sharded_analytics` as per above and you're using the `mongo-pump-aggregate`, but you now also have to add a `mongo-pump-selective` in order to save individual requests to Mongo, which the Dashboard can read into the Log Browser.
