2. In the **Add user** dialog, enter **First** and **Last** names, and **Email**.
3. Select an organization to which to register your user.
4. You can also set a password for a user by typing it in the **Set password** field. Check the **User must change password at the next login** if you wish your developer to change their password at next login.
Please note, that you can either send the invite email or set the password yourself, but you cannot use both methods.

5. Click **Save** to add your user.
6. To generate the invite email, click **More Options** in the Overview section and then **Send invite**.
The user will receive an email with a link to the registration form. This option is only available if you didn't set the password before.
To customize the invite email, please refer to the [Email customization section]({{< ref "tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/customise-enterprise-portal/full-customisation/email-customization.md" >}}) for guidance.
