## Introduction

Environments are used to group your [Control Plane]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#control-plane" >}}) and [Cloud Data Planes]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#cloud-data-plane" >}}) into logical groups. For example you may want to create environments that reflect different departments of your organization.

The number of Environments you can create is determined by your [plan]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/account-billing/plans" >}})

## Editing an Existing Environment

An Org Admin can perform the following:
