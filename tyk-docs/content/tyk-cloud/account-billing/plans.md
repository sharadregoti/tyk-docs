### Boostable Overages

Overages allow your consumption to go over the monthly limit, which can be an easy way to deal with for example seasonal or unexpected spikes in traffic. The overage level will be automatically charged based on your throughput on a monthly basis.

### Changing plans

You can upgrade or downgrade your current plan at any point in your billing cycle and your payment will be pro-rata'd to reflect the new payment.

### Downgrading plan requirements

If you downgrade your plan, the new plan may have less entitlements than your current plan. You will need to restructure your organization to comply with the new plan entitlements before the downgraded billing starts.

### Checking the Tyk Cloud status

If you want to check if there are issues with the environments and any upcoming down times, you can go to the [Tyk Status](https://status.tyk.io/) page.
