## Introduction

Following organization setup, you will have to set up your team(s) on Tyk Cloud. This page will tell you all about the process.

## What is a team?

* A team is a sub-grouping inside an organization. 
* Inside a team, you can define users(team members) and roles(permissions that can be applied to a user or a team of users).

## Steps to set up your team

After creating your Organization you'll land on the success screen. Click **Get Started**.

* **Step 1 - Name your Team:** Give your [Team]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#team" >}}) a name. You may find it useful to reflect the names used within your organization.

* **Step Two - Invite your Users:** Invite your [users]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#user" >}}) to your team. You'll only need their email address and which of the available [roles]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary#role" >}}) you want to assign to them. This step is optional and can be completed within the dashboard later.

## User Roles in Tyk Cloud

Out of the box, the following roles are setup:

* **Team member:** They can manage deployment activity for the team they are added to.
* **Team admin:** They can manage deployment activity and users for the team they are added to.
* **Organization admin:** They can manage deployment activity and users for a single organization.

Next you'll create an [Environment]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/setup-environment" >}}).
