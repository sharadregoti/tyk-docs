## Introduction

You can use Tyk Cloud to manage your APIs effectively and with minimal effort. This page explains how to create an account, in order to start doing so.

## What happens when you create your Tyk Cloud account?

When you create your Tyk Cloud account, we do the following for you:

* Assign the account creator as a [Billing admin]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles.md" >}}) for the Organization. This user role allows you to manage the billing and plans for your org. You can also add other billing admins as required.
* Assign the new account to our [5 weeks free trial plan](https://tyk.io/sign-up/#cloud)

## Creating your first account

[Start here](https://tyk.io/sign-up/#cloud).

* To create your account, you will have to fill in first-level details like your first name, last name and email.
* Then, set up a password for your Tyk Cloud account.
* Following that check the box at the bottom of the page to confirm that you have read and accepted our [Terms and Conditions](https://tyk.io/software-as-a-service-agreement/).
* Finally, click **Create new account**
* After completing the Account Creation form, click **Start Organization Setup**.
