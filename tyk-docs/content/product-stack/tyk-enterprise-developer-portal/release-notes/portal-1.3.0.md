## Release Highlights
#### API Analytics UI for developers
We added the new **API Analytics UI** which extends self-service capabilities for developers. This provides developers with an ability to analyze performance of the APIs which they consume, in addition to traffic composition for their apps. 
The **API Analytics UI** has four tabs that help developers to navigate different analytical views:
- **The overview tab** provides an overarching view on the API Products consumed by a developer. This tab has all information needed to quickly digest the current state of API Products, including: total traffic, number of errors, error breakdown by response code and top APIs by error code.

- **The Total API Calls** tab enables developers to analyze traffic from their application to the APIs they consume and how itâ€™s changing over time.

- **The Errors** tab provides developers with information relating to total errors and error rates. Here developers can identify any issues with the APIs which they consume without filling any support tickets. Developers can switch between the total number of error and error rates.

- **The Latency tab** helps developers to analyze response time of the APIs they consume so that they can factor for it in their applications.

#### Theme management API
The theme management API enables SDLC for the theme management in the portal. Admin users can leverage this API to programmatically:
- Create new themes.
- Update existing themes.
- Select the currently active theme.

#### Enhanced error logging for DCR and SSO flows
We introduced more verbose error logging for the DCR flow and for Single Sign-On to help customers set up the SSO and DCR faster. This is especially important for complex environments with highly customized or non-standard IdPs.
