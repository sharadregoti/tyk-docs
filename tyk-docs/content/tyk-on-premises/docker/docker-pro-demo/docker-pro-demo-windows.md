The Tyk Pro Docker demo is our full [On-Premises](https://tyk.io/api-gateway/on-premise/) Pro solution, which includes our Gateway, Dashboard, and analytics processing pipeline. This demo will run Tyk Self-Managed Pro on your machine, which contains 5 containers: Tyk Gateway, Tyk Dashboard, Tyk Pump, Redis and MongoDB. This demo is great for proof of concept and demo purposes, but if you want to test performance, you will need to move each component to a separate machine.

You use this at your own risk. Tyk is not supported on the Windows platform. However you can test it as a proof of concept using our Pro Demo Docker installation.

## Prerequisites

- MS Windows 10 Pro
- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) running with a signed in [Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/)
- Git for Windows
- PowerShell running as administrator
- Postman for [Windows](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)
- Our Pro Demo Docker [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pro-docker-demo)
- A free Tyk Self-Managed [Developer license](https://tyk.io/product/tyk-on-premises-free-edition/)

### Step One - Clone the Repo

Clone the repo above to a location on your machine.

### Step Two - Edit your hosts file

You need to add the following to your Windows hosts file:

```bash
127.0.0.1 www.tyk-portal-test.com
127.0.0.1 www.tyk-test.com
```

### Step Three - Add your Developer License

You should have received your free developer license via email. Copy the license key in the following location from your `\confs\tyk_analytics.conf` file:

```yaml
{
  ...
  "license_key": "<LICENSE-KEY>"
  ...
}
```

### Step Four - Run the Docker Compose File

From PowerShell, run the following command from your installation folder:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will will download and setup the five Docker containers. This may take some time and will display all output.

### Step Five - Test the Tyk Dashboard URL

Go to:

```bash
127.0.0.1:3000
```

You should get to the Tyk Dashboard Setup screen:

### Step Six - Create your Organization and Default User

You need to enter the following:

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

For a password, we recommend a combination of alphanumeric characters, with both upper and lower case
letters.
{{< /note >}}

Click **Bootstrap** to save the details.

You can now log in to the Tyk Dashboard from `127.0.0.1:3000`, using the username and password created in the Dashboard Setup screen.

### Step Seven - Set up a Portal Catalog

- **URL**: `127.0.0.1:3000/api/portal/catalogue`
- **Header**: Key `Authorzation` Value `SECRET_VALUE`
- **Body** (raw set to application/json):

#### Sample Request

```json
{ "org_id": "5d07b4b0661ea80001b3d40d" }
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "Status": "OK",
  "Message": "5d07b4b0661ea80001b3d40d",

}
```
