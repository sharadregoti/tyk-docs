Users that are signed up to your portal are called "Developers", these users have access to a Dashboard page which show them their API usage over the past 7 days as well as the policy and quota limits on their relevant keys.

Developers can sign up to multiple APIs using the API catalog.

Developer accounts belong to an organization ID, so accounts cannot be shared across organizations in a Tyk Dashboard setup.
